# JAVA_VirtualWar
# Goal
This software is a video game that allows two robot teams to compete on a 2-dimensional board. One of the teams can be controlled by the computer (artificial intelligence).
It was developed as part of the DUT (two-year university degree in technology) in 2015, so I was still a beginner in programming.
# Features
The user is able to:
- define the game's settings (number of players [1 or 2], number of robots by team, robot types);
- start a quick game (against AI, game settings automatically defined);
- play with the keyboard or the mouse.
